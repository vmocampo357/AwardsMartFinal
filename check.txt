x When editing, make sure they can't edit rows from other carts not in session
x If product doesnt have sizes, show a bad bad page (or..don't show them!)
x Make sure (is active) is checked everywhere
x Prompt before delete
x When adding to cart, need to make sure they at least select (1)
x When validating server side, or if there are any issues anywhere, do flashes
x On search, have some kind of loading thing
x If no products, say so
x NO fucking foreign keys
x Put content in from the CMS pages
